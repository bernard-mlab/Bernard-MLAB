Finally! That's the thought I had when I finished this blog site with a few more touch up to the contents and layout.

I had just finished a 12 weeks intensive course on Data Science and the parting words from the instructor was "_This is not the end guys, this is just the beginning. Continue to hone your skills..._"

Now that I have a some 'me' time, I reflected on how this 12 weeks has made an impact on me.

## What have I been up to?

After being in the banking industry for 10+ years, from living the pre-lehman life, surviving the sub-prime crisis, to the period where banks are under scrutiny from regulators their tsunami of compliance requirements, I figure that it was the time for me to explore area beyond the world of banking and finance.
I have always been keen in analyzing stuffs, and the biggest joy from my analysis, is that I find unexpected insights. I was exploring some data science and python course on Udemy, when I happened to chance across an introductory talk to data science by General Assembly (GA). During the talk, I was intrigued by how one can bring value to the organisation when they leverage on data science & machine learning.   

## 12 weeks of 'monk life'

Fast forward 2 months, here I was, sitting in the class with 22 fellow budding data science classmates. Without boring you with the details, in general, I would breakdown my 12 weeks experience in to the follow points.

- Your classmates and instructional team will be your FAMILY.
- Google & Stack Overflow are your best FRIEND.
- Youtube will be your tuition teacher.
- Community learning is the best way to expedite your learning.
- Getting clean dataset is like finding unicorn.
- Start small, start simple.
- You'll spend 80% of your time to clean the data, 20% for the more sexy stuffs. (model building / optimisation / deployment)
- Be like medieval monks, organise weekly beer sessions.
  - Besides keeping sanity, it may have unintended side effect of helping you to code faster.
- There's never a best way to a problem/ model, it DEPENDS.

## Going Forward

I will continue to hone my skills in Data science and Machine learning technique to stay sharp. (More readings and keeping myself abreast of new techniques from fellow practitioners!)

I will also post more mini-projects in my portfolio page to share my findings.

Hope to see ya around!
