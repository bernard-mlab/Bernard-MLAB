This is second of a series of articles where I explore how knowing statistics can be helpful to a digital marketer in a simplified view. <!--more-->

In this article, I will cover some examples of continuous probability distributions. You can refer to my earlier article on [`discrete probability distributions`]({{<ref "probability-distribution.md">}}).  

### Recap 

In the last article, a simple way to understand if your data is discrete or continuous is to answer the question: **"Are the number of your outcomes finite?"**

A "No" to the above would mean that the dataset is likely to continuous. 

### Examples of Continuous Probability Distributions

#### Uniform Distribution

Similarly to the Discrete Uniform distribution, the Uniform distribution represents variables that are evenly distributed over a given interval. Unlike the Discrete Uniform distribution, where values are countable (finite), the variables in the Continuous Uniform distribution are infinite (uncountable), such as, revenue over ads spends, profit margin.  

#### Normal (Gaussian) Distribution

Also commonly known as Gaussian distribution or bell curve, the main difference between Normal distribution and Binomial distribution is that Normal distribution is continuous. This means that while there are finite amount of events (_**no values** between one FB like & two FB likes_) in a Binomial distribution, in the Normal distribution, the number is infinite within a range (_multiple values exists between $1 & $2_ ).

#### Exponential Distribution

### Distribution Choices

There are many different types of distributions and each one describes a different situation, and I hope with this overview of the different distributions, it can help you understand the situation where these distributions exists.
