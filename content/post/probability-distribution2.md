This is second of a series of articles where I explore how knowing statistics can be helpful to a digital marketer in a simplified view. <!--more-->

In this article, I will cover some examples of continuous probability distributions. You can refer to my earlier article on [`discrete probability distributions`]({{<ref "probability-distribution.md">}}).  

### Recap 

In the last article, a simple way to understand if your data is discrete or continuous is to answer the question: **"Are the number of your outcomes finite?"**

A no to the above would mean that the dataset is likely to continuous. 

### Examples of Continuous Probability Distributions

#### Uniform Distribution
