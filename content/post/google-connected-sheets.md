### GSuite: Connected Sheets  

As your marketing work expands, it will come a point where it makes more sense to store your data on a database instead of spreadsheet. There are many options available to host and store your data from various data source (eg: _Google Cloud/ AWS/ Azure/ on-prem_), and if you are storing your data on Google Cloud Big Query (BQ), you will be pleased to know that Google has rolled out "Connected Sheets", an integration between G-Sheets and BigQuery.  

Google integrating BigQuery connection into G-Sheets means that analyst or marketeer will be able to query for data and insights quickly without worrying about the technicalities in the set-up. 

At the time of this article, this functionality is made available only for GSuite users.
